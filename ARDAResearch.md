# Research Methodology

To explore these objectives, a **qualitative research methodology** is suggested, leveraging in-depth responses.  

---

## 1. Research Design: Qualitative Approach
- **Qualitative Interviews or Focus Groups**  
  - Gather rich, detailed responses.  
  - Allow open-ended questions to capture deeper insights into opinions, beliefs, and experiences.  
- **Surveys with Open-Ended Questions**  
  - Useful if interviews aren’t feasible with large groups.  
  - Still allows for capturing rich and varied qualitative data.  

---

## 2. Sampling Strategy
- **Purposive sampling**: Target student groups likely to have strong opinions or knowledge, such as:
  - Computer science, cybersecurity, or game development students (technical insights).  
  - Gamers or e-sports players (firsthand experience with anti-cheat measures).  
- **Sample size**:  
  - 15–30 students for interviews or focus groups.  
  - Larger groups possible for surveys.  

---

## 3. Data Collection Process
- **Interview Guide**: Develop structured guiding questions.  
- **Recording & Transcription**: Record sessions (with consent) and transcribe for analysis.  

---

## 4. Data Analysis
- **Thematic Analysis**: Identify and analyse recurring themes.  
- **Coding Categories**:  
  - Start with categories such as *privacy concerns*, *trust in technology*, *security benefits*.  
  - Expand based on emerging themes.  
- **Interpretation**: Connect findings back to research objectives, noting factors that influence acceptance or rejection of kernel-level anti-cheat.

# Data Analysis Plan
- **Code Responses**:  
  - Initial codes such as *privacy concerns*, *security benefits*, *performance impact*, *trust issues*.  
- **Identify Themes**:  
  - Group similar codes into overarching themes (e.g., *Privacy vs. Security Tradeoff*, *Trust in Developers vs. Distrust of Technology*).  
- **Interpret Findings**:  
  - Link themes back to research objectives.  
  - Identify factors promoting or discouraging acceptance of kernel-level anti-cheat.
