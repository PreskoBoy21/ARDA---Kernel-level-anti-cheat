# Research Objectives

In a **quantitative study**, the aims are to:

- **Measure Awareness**: Quantify how aware students are of kernel-level anti-cheat systems.  
- **Gauge Acceptability**: Determine how acceptable students find kernel-level anti-cheat technology.  
- **Assess Concerns**: Quantify specific concerns (privacy, performance, security) that influence acceptance.  
- **Identify Trust Levels**: Measure how much trust students place in developers/companies using this technology.  
- **Correlate with Background Factors**: Explore links between factors (e.g., gaming experience, tech knowledge) and opinions on kernel-level anti-cheat.

# Research Methodology

## 1. Research Design: Quantitative Survey
- **Structured Survey**: Closed-ended questions (multiple-choice, Likert scales).  
- **Scalability**: Distribute online for ease of access.  
- **Sample Size**: 100–200 students for robust statistical analysis.  

---

## 2. Sampling Strategy
- **Stratified Sampling**: Capture responses across demographics (e.g., major, gaming habits).  
- **Incentives**: Consider offering participation rewards to boost response rates.  

---

## 3. Data Collection
- **Survey Platform**: Use online tools (Google Forms, SurveyMonkey).  
- **Anonymity**: Ensure anonymous responses to encourage honesty.  

---

## 4. Data Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate means, medians, frequencies.  
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare subgroups (gamers vs. non-gamers, tech vs. non-tech students).  
- **Correlation & Regression**: Test relationships (e.g., does tech knowledge correlate with acceptance?).

# Data Analysis Plan
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize general attitudes (means, frequencies).  
- **Cross-Tabulations**: Compare opinions by gaming frequency, field of study, technical background.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explore links (e.g., trust vs. acceptance, privacy concerns vs. willingness).  
- **Regression Analysis**: Predict acceptance of kernel-level anti-cheat based on privacy, trust, and gaming habits.
