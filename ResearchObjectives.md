# Research Objectives

In a **literature review**, the aims are to:

- **Synthesize Awareness Research**: Synthesize existing research and discourse on user awareness of kernel-level anti-cheat technologies and associated risks.
- **Analyse Acceptance Patterns**: Analyse patterns in user acceptance and attitudes toward games requiring kernel-level anti-cheat systems as reflected in academic literature and public discourse.
- **Consolidate Concerns**: Review and consolidate findings on privacy concerns, security worries, and trust in game developers among users.
- **Identify Influencing Factors**: Identify factors (technical knowledge, gaming habits, demographic characteristics) that influence user perceptions, as documented in existing research and discussions.
- **Examine Perceived Invasiveness**: Examine how perceived invasiveness relates to acceptance of these technologies, based on existing evidence.
- **Identify Research Gaps**: Identify gaps in current knowledge and areas requiring further empirical research.

# Research Methodology

## 1. Research Design: Systematic Literature Review
- **Literature Review Approach**: Systematic synthesis of existing knowledge across multiple source types.
- **Source Integration**: Combines academic research, technical documentation, technology journalism, and community discourse.
- **Scope**: Comprehensive overview of user perceptions rather than primary data collection.
- **Purpose**: Identify patterns, contradictions, and gaps in existing understanding.

## 2. Source Types

Sources included in the review:

- **Academic Research**: Peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, academic databases (Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library)
- **Technical Documentation**: Official whitepapers and documentation from Riot Games (Vanguard), Epic Games (Easy Anti-Cheat), BattlEye
- **Technology Journalism**: Reputable technology publications (e.g., XDA Developers)
- **Community Discourse**: Platforms like Reddit and GitHub discussions
- **Industry Data**: Gaming industry databases tracking anti-cheat adoption (e.g., Levvvel)

# Research Questions

Based on the research problem and objectives, the following research questions guide this literature review:

1. **Awareness**: What do existing sources reveal about user awareness of kernel-level anti-cheat systems and their implications?
2. **Acceptability**: How do users evaluate the acceptability of kernel-level anti-cheat technologies in online games, according to existing research and discourse?
3. **Primary Concerns**: What are the primary concerns (privacy, security, transparency) that influence user perceptions, as documented in the literature?
4. **Trust Levels**: What levels of trust do users place in game developers and companies that implement kernel-level anti-cheats, based on existing evidence?
5. **Influencing Factors**: What factors (technical knowledge, gaming experience, demographic characteristics) are associated with user acceptance or rejection of kernel-level anti-cheat systems in existing research?
6. **Research Gaps**: What gaps exist in current understanding of user perceptions that require further empirical investigation?

# Research Propositions

Based on the context, research problem, and objectives, the following propositions derived from existing literature guide this review:

- **P1**: Users with greater awareness of kernel-level anti-cheat systems exhibit higher levels of privacy concerns, as suggested by technical communities and cybersecurity discussions.
- **P2**: Users exhibit lower trust toward companies that implement kernel-level anti-cheats, as evidenced in public discourse and community discussions.
- **P3**: Users with greater technical knowledge express stronger concerns about kernel-level drivers, as reflected in cybersecurity and technical community perspectives.
- **P4**: Despite concerns, some users are willing to sacrifice privacy for fair gameplay, as indicated by continued adoption of games requiring kernel-level anti-cheat.
- **P5**: Higher perceived invasiveness negatively correlates with acceptance of kernel-level anti-cheat systems, as suggested by privacy-focused discussions and user complaints.

# Analysis Plan

## 1. Source Quality Assessment
- **Academic Sources**: Peer review status, methodology rigor, sample size and representativeness (where applicable)
- **Technical Documentation**: Official source status, technical accuracy, completeness of information
- **Journalism and Community Sources**: Author credibility, source verification, breadth of perspective represented

## 2. Thematic Synthesis
- Identify consistent themes across source types
- Document contradictions and areas of disagreement
- Analyze how different perspectives (technical vs. general users) shape findings
- Note limitations and biases in different source types

## 3. Gap Identification
- Identify areas where empirical research is lacking
- Note questions unanswered by current literature
- Highlight inconsistencies in existing knowledge
- Recommend priorities for future research

## 4. Comparative Analysis
- Compare perspectives between technically literate and general users
- Analyze differences in concerns, trust, and acceptance patterns
- Examine how source type (academic vs. community discourse) influences findings
- Identify consensus areas vs. contested claims

# Conclusion

This **literature review approach** enables comprehensive synthesis of fragmented knowledge on user perceptions of kernel-level anti-cheat systems. By systematically integrating diverse source types—academic research, technical documentation, technology journalism, and community discourse—this review provides a holistic overview that individual sources cannot achieve alone. The thematic analysis and synthesis identify consistent patterns, reveal contradictions, and highlight critical gaps in current understanding, thereby establishing a foundation for evidence-based discussions and guiding future empirical research priorities.
